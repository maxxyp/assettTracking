            DEFINITE TODOs:
                1) the multi-visit parts stuff, retain the non-todays-parts
                2) supplementaryLabourChargeTotal - does this just come down and go back up?  with no effect on calculations?
                    - I think this is pence, but what does it come down as? - question
                3) standardLabourChargeIndicator is wrong
                    - we only set it if we are charging a standard amount - done

            QUESTIONS:
                1) what units is supplementaryLabourChargeTotal
                2) get clarification on supplementaryLabourChargeTotal, standardLabourChargeIndicator & standardPricePartsCharged
                3) multi-visits - do we observe warranty returns too in the previous activities?
                    - extra stautus stuff that we need to observe too? ask Nehal
                4) Just when a task is completed do we send back parts?
                    - do we need CX as well as C
                5) Charge dispute - which value should we send?

                0) what is standard parts price charged? - a value or an indicator
                    - done - we don't have this concept anymore
                1) parts VAT - is it really the same as the task VAT?
                    - done - we don't have this concept anymore
                2) parts - we have no concept as prime and subsequent standard charge for parts in our code yet, although it is in reference data see IJcChargeRule.ts....
                    - done - doesn't look like this concept is used anymore
                3) should we be driving partscharged of chargeService - it is a bit weird that we don't...
