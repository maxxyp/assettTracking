- check jobService -> checkIfJobFinishTimeNeedsToBeUpdated works still
- reinstate commented out tests in tasks.spec.ts
    - double check logic on tasks that sets start and end time (where it falls back to tasks rather than _liveTasks)
    - clear button on taskItem and general taskItem stuff
    - check getting on to taskItem page before arriving the jobd
    TaskItemViewModel helpers
- test across hour boundary maybe

check zero minutes are allowed

TIME UPDATE LOGIC
=================

Initialising:
    initialising task when job is created
    - in jobService but callsTaskItemViewModel static methods

Lifecycle:
        creating a task
        - goes to the end with one minute duration from the last live task

        deleting a task
        - shift all subsequent live tasks time up to slot in to missing time

        cancelling a task
        - as per deleting, and set times and duration to null

        reinstating a task
        - if a predecessor exists take a minute from predecessor
        - if a predecessor does not exists and a successor exists, take a minute from the successor
        - if any live task has 0 then add 1 and take from the predecessor (basically logic to spread all the tasks out)

logic for live tasks - both tasks page and taskItem page are interested

SLIDER PAGE
===========
    - disable DELETE on No ACCESS


TASK ITEM LEVEL STUFF
================

    taskItemViewModel continue tidy up

    taskItem page
        - does duration etc get updated for XBed when we XB on the page and when we come in to an previously XBed task
        - editing when not arrived

    - clear on task item page
        - single item and mutliple

    - what setTimeRangePicker is doing
        - calculates if we can edit or not
    - bringing back an XB when it is a) only task and b) one of many live tasks

    - manually changing chargeable time
    - reinstating an XBed task, is chargeable time set to 1 ok?

    duration = 0 stuff
